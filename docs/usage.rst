Using django-simple-menu
========================

Usage Overview
--------------

``django-simple-menu`` lets you define multiple different menus that you can
access from within your templates. This way you can have a menu for your main
navigation, another menu for logged in users, another menu for anonymous users,
etc.

.. note::

    Since we use the ``menu`` namespace you will get ``ImportError`` if you
    have any files named ``menu.py``, ensure you use a plural version:
    ``menus.py``

To define your menus you need to create a file named ``menus.py`` inside of the
app that you wish to hook menus up to. In the ``menus.py`` file you should
import the ``Menu`` and ``MenuItem`` classes from the ``menu`` package::

    from menu import Menu, MenuItem

The ``Menu`` class exposes a class method named ``add_item`` that accepts two
arguments; the menu name you want to add to, and the ``MenuItem`` you're going
to add.

The ``MenuItem`` class should be instantiated and passed to the ``add_item``
class method with the appropriate parameters. ``MenuItem`` accepts a wide
number of options to its constructor method, the majority of which are simply
attributes that become available in your templates when you're rendering out
the menus. The required arguments to MenuItem are the first two; the title of
the menu and the URL, and the keywords that affect menu generation are:

* The ``weight`` keyword argument affects sorting of the menu.
* The ``children`` keyword argument is either a list of ``MenuItem`` objects,
  or a callable which accepts the request object and returns a list.
* The ``check`` keyword argument is a callable that accepts the request object
  and returns ``True`` or ``False`` if the ``MenuItem`` should be visible for
  this request

Additional kwargs can be passed to ``MenuItem`` and these will become
available in your templates. For example adding ``separator=True`` could be
used to add separators to menus ``{% if item.separator %}<li
class="divider"></li>{% endif %}``

For the full list of ``MenuItem`` options see the `menu __init__.py source file`_. 

Usage Example
-------------

Example::

    # Add two items to our main menu
    Menu.add_item("main", MenuItem("Tools",
                                   reverse("myapp.views.tools"),
                                   weight=10,
                                   icon="tools"))

    Menu.add_item("main", MenuItem("Reports",
                                   reverse("myapp.views.reports"),
                                   weight=20,
                                   icon="report"))


    # Define children for the my account menu
    myaccount_children = (
        MenuItem("Edit Profile",
                 reverse("accounts.views.editprofile"),
                 weight=10,
                 icon="user"),
        MenuItem("Admin",
                 reverse("admin:index"),
                 weight=80,
                 separator=True,
                 check=lambda request: request.user.is_superuser),
        MenuItem("Logout",
                 reverse("accounts.views.logout"),
                 weight=90,
                 separator=True,
                 icon="user"),
    )

    # Add a My Account item to our user menu
    Menu.add_item("user", MenuItem("My Account",
                                   reverse("accounts.views.myaccount"),
                                   weight=10,
                                   children=myaccount_children))


Once you have your menus defined you need to incorporate them into your
templates. This is done through the ``generate_menu`` template tag::

    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% load menu %}
    
    {% block content %}
    {% generate_menu %}
    ...
    {% endblock %}

Note that ``generate_menu`` must be called inside of a block.

Once you call ``generate_menu`` all of your MenuItems will be evaluated and
the following items will be set in the context for you. 

#. ``menus`` - This is an object that contains all of the lists of menus as
   attribute names::

       {% for item in menus.user %} ... {% endfor %}

#. ``selected_menu`` - This is the ``MenuItem`` object of the most specific
   URL match.
#. ``submenu`` - This is the submenu object of the most specific URL match.
#. ``has_submenu`` - This is ``True`` or ``False`` if the selected menu has
   children.


See the bootstrap-navbar.html file in the templates dir of the source code for
an example that renders menus for the `Twitter Bootstrap Navbar Component`_.
You can use it like::

    {% with menu=menus.main %}{% include "bootstrap-navbar.html" %}{% endwith %}


Check generalizations
---------------------

If your application is dynamic enough, or complex enough, you may find that you
want to generalize your check logic based on a permissions model, or something
similar.  To accomplish this you can create your own custom ``MenuItem``
implementation with a ``check`` method.

This assumes you have a ``utils`` package.

``utils/menus.py``::

    from django.core.urlresolvers import resolve

    from menu import MenuItem


    class ViewMenuItem(MenuItem):
        """Custom MenuItem that checks permissions based on the view associated
        with a URL"""

        def check(self, request):
             """Check permissions based on our view"""
             is_visible = True
             match = resolve(self.url)

             # do something with match, and possibly change is_visible...

             self.visible = is_visible


``reports/menus.py``::

     from utils.menus import ViewMenuItem

     from menu import Menu, MenuItem

     from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse

     # Since we use ViewMenuItem here we do not need to define checks, instead
     # the check logic will change their visibility based on the permissions
     # attached to the views we reverse here.
     reports_children = (
          ViewMenuItem("Staff Only", reverse("reports.views.staff")),
          ViewMenuItem("Superuser Only", reverse("reports.views.superuser"))
     )

     Menu.add_item("main", MenuItem("Reports Index",
                                    reverse("reports.views.index"),
                                    children=reports_children))
